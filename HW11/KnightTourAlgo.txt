Task: Express your algorithm for generating a sequence of moves a knight may
make to touch each square of an n*n grid exactly once --- or to determine that
this task is impossible.

 Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Checks if the the knight has visited all the squares by seeing if the knight
had made n*n moves.

2. If it is true then that is the solution.

3. If it is false then add a move and recursively check it this move leads
to a solution.

4. If it doesn't lead to the solution then remove that move and add another
move.

5. If none of the moves work then it is impossible.
